# Kickstarter

Nowadays, people who do not have enough money but have good ideas to start businesses can utilize crowdfunding to realize their ideas. Their ideas can relate to lots of fields such as art, music or technology. However, over half of the ideas may not get enough funding to realize.

This project aims to analyze the potential information inside Kickstarter's programs and tries to give people some advice on crowdfunding. In the end, based on the information discovered from the data, people who have ideas of crowdfunding will have a better understanding of whether their projects will be successful.

The original dataset is from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects#ks-projects-201801.csv, which includes some records of Kickstarter until 2018/01. I deleted some very old records and modified them in order to better analyze the data.. By analyzing the state of the all the records in each main categories (which is shown in Figure 1), the projects in the main categories "Comics", "Dance", "Music", "Theater" are more likely to be successful while other categories are more unlikely to succeed especially "Crafts", "Fashion", "Food", "Journalism" and "Technology". Next, we are curious about some potential reasons that different categories have different chances of success. First, from Figure 2, it is surprised that for different categories, the average money for each backer is almost the same. Therefore, the goal money for each project is analyzed and Figure 3 is obtained. We can see that it is common that successful projects have relative lower goal money. This can give a guideline for people to set suitable goal money for their projects.
